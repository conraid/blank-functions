Wordpress Plugin to load functions without functions.php theme file.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to insert functions as if you were using the theme's functions.php file. 
Very useful if you are using builders like Oxygen, which do not have a theme.
Or if you change themes often. 
In this case I recommend writing the non-theme-specific functions in this file, and the theme-specific functions in the theme's functions.php file.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload the plugin files to the '/wp-content/plugins/blank-functions' directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress

== Configuration ==

No configuration is necessary.

Write your functions in blank-functions.php file as you would in the theme's functions.php file.
